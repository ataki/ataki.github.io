Perfect shuffling is tricky. I use it as a good example of developing programming intuition. 

Early on when students are learning how to code, they tend not to pay attention to small details. Pointers vs dereferencing, pseudo-random, using catch-all exception handling...whatever the hell gets the job done.

When I first learned about sorting / shuffling, I didn't even realize that bias was a problem. What's the matter, just pick two random indices and swap. That's the definition of shuffling, right?

I'll skip the explanation on why that approach doesn't work, it's been covered a lot on the interwebs. I'll just leave this as a note to self: the intuition is that imperfect shuffling leads to <b>biases in the outcome space</b>. As simple as that is, I keep forgetting, and I'm sure there's more than a few people who forget too.
