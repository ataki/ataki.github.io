  <h1>Data Mesh</h1>
  <p>
    I'm currently an Engineering Manager building out our data mesh. This includes
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/flexport/jobs/2390393?t=0299321c1us">building out the team</a></li>
      <li>defining data platform strategy</li>
      <li>setting roadmaps, aligning stakeholders</li>
      <li>driving alignment across orgs</li>
      <li>some tech leading</li>
    </ul>

    Honestly this is already 90% of my life. I love to be connected to folks working on this, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhengjim/">send me an invite</a>

  <h1>Leadership and Volunteering</h1>
  <p>
  In the spare time I have, I'm trying to give back in two ways. One is leadership training for Asian Americans in tech. There's a disproportionate lack of representation in tech company leadership roles. Part of the reason is a culture and communication gap, especially for managers coming from overseas. Other reasons, perhaps harder to grasp, are stereotypes and representation. Our goal is to establish a set of common principles across industries to address the root causes.

  The second is volunteering. I'm open to tutoring and coaching opportunities for pre-college kids, and new grads looking to get into the engineering market. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhengjim/">If you'd like to speak, send me an invite</a>

  <h1>Reading</h1>
  <p>
  I'm currently reading the <a href="http://streamingsystems.net">Streaming Systems Book</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">Big Blue Book</a> on Domain Driven Design.
  My anti-library is full of readings on history and macroeconomics.
  <ul>
    <li>Ray Dalio, The New World Order</li>
    <li>John Barry, The Great Influenza</li>
    <li>Ascent of Money</li>
    <li>The Manager's Path</li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Chess</h1>
  <p>
  I'm playing a lot of online blitz chess at chess.com. This is partially inspired by watching Queen's Gambit. Play me at chess.com.
