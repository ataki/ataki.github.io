  <h1>Data Mesh</h1>
  <p>
    I'm currently an Engineering Manager building out our data mesh. This includes
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/flexport/jobs/2390393?t=0299321c1us">building out the team</a></li>
      <li>defining data platform strategy</li>
      <li>setting roadmaps, aligning stakeholders</li>
      <li>driving alignment across orgs</li>
      <li>some tech leading</li>
    </ul>

    Honestly this is already 90% of my life. I love to be connected to folks working on this, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhengjim/">send me an invite</a>

  <h1>Leadership and Volunteering</h1>
  <p>
  In the spare time I have, I'm trying to give back in two ways. One is leadership training for Asian Americans in tech. There's a lack of representation in leadership roles for Asian Americans. It's getting better, but there's a culture gap, especially for managers coming from overseas. Our goal is to establish a set of common principles across industries to bridge that cultural gap.

  The second is volunteering. I'm open to tutoring and coaching opportunities for pre-college kids, and new grads looking to get into the engineering market. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhengjim/">If you'd like to speak, send me an invite</a>

  <h1>Chess</h1>
  <p>
  I'm playing a lot of online blitz chess. This is partially inspired by watching Queen's Gambit. Play me at chess.com.
