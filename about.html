      I help build our data platform at <a href="https://invoice2go.com">Flexport</a>. Before that, I worked at <a href="https://meettally.com">Tally</a> where we helped build a bank to serve underserved consumers pay off their debt, and <a href="https://www.invoice2go.com">Invoice2go</a> before that.
        Once upon a time, I was a bright eyed student studying HCI and Machine Learning. I've worked in tech since 2012-13 starting at <a href="http://startx.stanford.edu">StartX</a>. I held an advisory role at <a href="http://www.boomtownboulder.com/">Boomtown Accelerator</a>.

        If you're in SF, I'd love to grab coffee. Contact me at (first.last) at (company-i-work-at).
