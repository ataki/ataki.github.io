        I currently build out data infrastructure at <a href="https://invoice2go.com">Invoice2go</a>. Before that, I led engineering at <a href="https://www.analyticsmd.com">AnalyticsMD</a>,
        and worked on roles at <a href="https://github.com/edx">OpenEDX</a> and <a href="https://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a>, and studied CS at Stanford. My focus there was HCI and Machine Learning.

        <br/>

        I moved from NY to the Bay Area when I was 18, and now currently reside in SF. I've had fun and learned a lot about myself while living
        abroad in Shanghai, Osaka, and Zurich.<br/>

        <br/>

        I've worked in tech since 2012-13 with the <a href="http://startx.stanford.edu">StartX</a> community. I held an advisory role at
        <a href="http://www.boomtownboulder.com/">Boomtown Accelerator</a>, and had fun trying to make my own.<br/>

        If you're in SF, I'd love to grab coffee. Contact me at (first.last) at (company-i-work-at).
