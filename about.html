    <h1>HI I'M JIM</h1>
    <p>
        I'll keep my life story short.<br/>

        <br/>

        I was born in China and immigrated to NY, then again to the Bay Area, where
        I've been living on and off for almost a decade.<br/>

        <br/>

        I'm currently helping cook up data at <a href="https://invoice2go.com">Invoice2go</a>.
        Before that, I led engineering at <a href="https://www.analyticsmd.com">AnalyticsMD</a>,
        supported the <a href="https://github.com/edx">OpenEdx</a> movement, and stuck around long
        enough to get a BS and Masters at <a href="https://www.stanford.edu">Stanford</a>.
        I've had fun and learned a lot about myself while living abroad in Shanghai, Osaka, and Zurich.<br/>

        <br/>

        I've been involved in the startup scene for a bit, starting from 2012-13 at
        <a href="http://startx.stanford.edu">StartX</a>. I held an advisory role at
        <a href="http://www.boomtownboulder.com/">Boomtown Accelerator</a>, and had fun trying to make
        my own in Steve Blank's Lean Launchpad class.<br/>

        <br/>

        I love beautiful code and crafted products. Beautiful code is concise and expressive.
        Beautifully crafted products train me well at using them and fit neatly into a user's lifestyle.
        In both, there is an attention to detail that gets noticed over time and use.<br/>

        <br/>

        If you're in the Bay Area and are so inclined, feel free to drop me a line!
        I'm always up for trading good stories and ideas over coffee / beer.
        Here's a list of topics I can chat somewhat intelligently about:
        <ul class="a-list">
            <li>Entrepreneurship</li>
            <li>Chess</li>
            <li>Design</li>
            <li>French, Latin, and Asian culture</li>
            <li>Traveling</li>
            <li>Dress Codes</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
