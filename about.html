        I'm an engineer by trade and designer by interest. I'm currently building out data infrastructure
        at <a href="https://invoice2go.com">Invoice2go</a>. Before that, I led engineering at <a href="https://www.analyticsmd.com">AnalyticsMD</a>,
        supported <a href="https://github.com/edx">OpenEDX</a>, sliced and diced data at <a href="https://salesforce.com">Salesforce</a>, and
        learned about machines at Stanford.<br/>

        <br/>

        I was born in China and immigrated to NY at a young age. I moved to the Bay Area when I was 18, where
        I now live for the most part. I've had fun and learned a lot about myself while living
        abroad in Shanghai, Osaka, and Zurich.<br/>

        <br/>

        I've been on the startup scene since 2012-13 with the community at
        <a href="http://startx.stanford.edu">StartX</a>. I held an advisory role at
        <a href="http://www.boomtownboulder.com/">Boomtown Accelerator</a>, and had fun trying to make
        my own.<br/>

        If you're in the Bay Area and are so inclined, feel free to drop me a line!
        I'm always up for trading good stories and ideas over coffee / beer.
        Here's a list of topics I can chat somewhat intelligently about:
        <ul class="a-list">
            <li>Entrepreneurship</li>
            <li>Chess</li>
            <li>Design</li>
            <li>European and Asian culture</li>
            <li>Traveling</li>
            <li>Dress Codes</li>
        </ul>
