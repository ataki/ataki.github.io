        I lead data infrastructure at <a href="https://www.flexport.com">Flexport</a>.
        We're building a modern platform to collect and analyze the world's freight data for insights.
        Before this, I built software to bring better financial services to small businesses and under-served consumers. Once upon a time, I studied human computer interaction and worked on <a href="https://www.spirehealth.com/">wearable health tech</a>.
    </p>
    <p>I believe software should be treated as a craft close to design. Interfaces, data, and algorithms are best when humanized.

        I moved to the Bay Area and spent an amazing decade there with an amazing cast of characters. I've lived abroad in Sydney, Osaka, and Zurich.
        I got started in tech in 2012 at <a href="http://startx.stanford.edu">StartX</a>. I held an advisory role at
        <a href="http://www.boomtownboulder.com/">Boomtown Accelerator</a>, and had fun trying to make my own.<br/>

        This blog is an outlet for personal thoughts that I've written down since 2012.

    <h1>â˜• I love to connect (virtually)</h1>
    <p>
        If you're in NY, I'd love to grab coffee or jump on a virtual call. My email is almost always (first.last) at (company-i-work-at).
