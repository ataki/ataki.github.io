      Before that, I worked at <a href="https://meettally.com">Tally</a> where we built a bank to help consumers pay off their debt.
      I've also worked in <a href="https://www.invoice2go.com">other fintech</a> startups, and been an <a href="http://www.boomtownboulder.com/">advisor</a>.

      I got started in tech at <a href="http://startx.stanford.edu">an accelerator</a>. Before that I spent <a href="https://www.stanford.edu">undergrad
      and grad school</a> studying computer science (mostly theory and systems). And before that I worked on the <a href="https://www.yahoo.com">front page</a> of the web.
