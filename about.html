        I lead data infrastructure at <a href="https://www.flexport.com">Flexport</a>.
        We're building a modern platform to make global trade data accessible for everyone.
        Before this, I built software to bring better financial services to small businesses and under-served consumers.
        Once upon a time, I worked on hci research at stanford, some of which have now become
        <a href="https://www.spirehealth.com/">wearable health tech</a>.

    <p>I believe software should be treated as a craft close to design. Interfaces, data, and algorithms are best when humanized.

        I moved to the Bay Area and spent an amazing decade there. I've also lived abroad in Sydney, Osaka, and Zurich.
        I got started in tech in 2012 at <a href="http://startx.stanford.edu">StartX</a>, held advisory roles at
        <a href="http://www.boomtownboulder.com/">Boomtown</a>, and had fun building quite a few companies.<br/>

        This blog is an outlet for personal thoughts that I've written down since 2012.

    <h1>â˜• I love to connect (virtually)</h1>
    <p>
        If you're in NY/SF, I'd love to grab coffee or jump on a virtual call. My email is almost always (first.last) at (company-i-work-at).
