      I hated Ruby. It looked and felt like it was made by cool kids, for cool kids. Too much magic.

      Then I had to learn it. And I gotta say, it's pretty. Here's a rundown:

        - great community and packages for web development - better than Python
        - as high level as Python

      The language wasn't designed for the web, but somehow seems perfectly positioned for modern web development.

      Here are some code samples to show you why:
