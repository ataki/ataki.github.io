Life for some people consists of peaks and valleys of activity. Sometimes the peak is particularly high. April 2015 is one such peak. It's been one month since I've started working at Invoice2go. During that time I've learned and experienced quite a lot.

<ul>
    <li>Started a job</li>
    <li>Traveled to NYC, Sydney, and NYC again.</li>
    <li>Made the decision to move to SF and found an apartment</li>
    <li>Passed the halfway point of my last class</li>
</ul>

Traveling and meeting new people makes time slow down because you're experiencing new things. Working makes things speed up because you lose track of time diving down rabbit holes. This whole month has felt like a never-ending, start-stop time warp. I'm only just starting the road to recovery, and blogging about it has been a relief from the chaos.
