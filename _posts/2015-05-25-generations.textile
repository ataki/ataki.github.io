I just came across an old email inviting a group of friends to see the Harry Potter 7 Part 2 Premier. It feels like it's been so long.

Recently while exploring the city, I've noticed people mentioning that Avengers, Snapchat, and Vine are getting old, and that they're
waiting for something new. I think back to what the current generation has seen culturally, and it's been overwhelming.

A long time ago I took a class in college in which the professor presented his theory of inheritance: namely, that there are 4 tracks that one
generation passes off to the other - genetic, cultural, social, and environmental. For me it was an interesting way to think about social transmission,
but probably old news for sociologists. Anyways, I wonder whether technology fits neatly into any of these categories; it seems to touch every aspect,
including now genetic. It may be the wrong way of thinking about it entirely, but for now I'll go with the added "5th track" - technology.
