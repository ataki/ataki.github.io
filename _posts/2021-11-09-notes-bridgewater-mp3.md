title: Bridgewater: Effects of  Monetary Policy 3 (Notes)
---

Bridgewater just published an article on the state of inflation. The article
can read a bit dense, so here are notes you can read in 3min.

* Read time: 3min
* [Article](https://www.bridgewater.com/its-mostly-a-demand-shock-not-a-supply-shock-and-its-everywhere)

# tl;dr
- 📈 it's a demand shock we're experiencing in 2021, not supply shortage
- high inflation is likely to be reasonably sustained due to continued lenient policies
- (my own opinion) if you hold assets, continue to hold post-covid. if you don't, buy
  more assets and increase your exposure to different asset classes

# Summary

## 🏔 Landscape
- Current news headlines in Q3/Q4 2021 cover low supply
- BUT, MP3 has really driven an upward demand shock in consumer goods
- There are not enough raw materials, energy, productive capacity, inventories, housing, or workers
- Consumer goods demand is unlikely to sustain, but demand for services (aka employment) will continue to lag
- Continued service lagging puts pressure on a labor market

## 📈 More about MP3
### Story for demand
- Government transfer massive amount of cash to households, more than offsetting lost income from covid
- Household balance shets are in materially better state than pre-pandemic
- This pushes up values of assets like equities, houses, crypto
- In short, houlsehods are wealthy, flush with cash and ready to spend
- **Self-reinforcing surge in demand**

### Story for supply
- There is not enough raw materials. Example: metal
	- Supply is much higher than in recent years, but prices are still rising
- There is not enough energy
	- Prices of natural gas, coal, oil are all spiking
	- But prices are rising because
- There's not enough housing
	- Not enough supply (of houses), so home prices are surging, as is rent
	- Housing prices take time to reflect
	- Extremely low interest rates and tight job market
	- Not enough labor
		- Half of all US firms cannot fill positions

## Next wave of inflationary pressures
1. Consumer good demand goes down
2. Increase spending on labor-intensive services
3. Ongoing shortage of labor will worsen
4. Inflation will become increasingly self-reinforcing

> For supply and demand to clear at levels that don't lead to sustained price increases,
> ther would need to be a massive investment in productivity for supply to catch up.
> The gap between demand and supply is now large enough that high inflation is likely
> to be reasonably sustained
