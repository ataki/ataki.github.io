I just had a pretty long and intense daydream about moving to Hong Kong. Parts of it are loosely inspired by a movie I watched about overseas Chinese moving back. It's something my parents had always envisioned I'd do. When I was young, I was convinced I'd ultimately move back, and that my home country was where I'd belong.

Why HK though? I guess it's the best fit for overseas Asians. I've been told HK represents the fantasies of what living could be like in China: weekend parties, underground clubs, meaningless nights. Crazy romances and ludicrous possibilities. 

What, you say we have those here in the Bay Area too? I know ... they're just not as exciting.

I wonder if many overseas Asians have to deal with this decision of moving back vs staying. It seems like a majority are comfortable with staying in their present situation. But how many of us have dreamt / thought about the possibility of moving back, and hesitated because of culture, friends, or security? How many of us feel stranded from our past, and uncertain about the future?
