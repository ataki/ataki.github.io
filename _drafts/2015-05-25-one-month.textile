Life for some people consists of peaks and valleys of activity. Sometimes the peak is particularly high. This is one such peak.
It's been one month since I've started working at Invoice2go. During that time I've learned and experienced quite a lot.

<ul>
    <li>Traveled to NYC, Sydney, and NYC again</li>
    <li>Started investing</li>
    <li>Made the decision to move to SF</li>
    <li>Passed the halfway point of my last (and toughest) class at Stanford</li>
</ul>

Traveling makes time slow down because you're experiencing new things. Working makes things speed up because you lose track
of time working on a problem. This whole month has felt like a never-ending, start-stop time warp. I'm only just starting the
road to recovery, and blogging about it has been a relief from the chaos.
