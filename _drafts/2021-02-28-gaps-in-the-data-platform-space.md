title: gaps in the data platform space
---

tldr;
* data communities are focused on "depth" (tooling, ideas)
* data platform encompasses a wide discipline and is underserved
* solution: bring together data platform practitioners to learn from each other

there's been a recent string of communities popping up in the data space. none dedicated to data platform learnings.
often the teams building data platforms are the ones gluing together all the tools to make a cohesive platform experience. we fight the same fights, encounter the same issues. a list of them:
* design of online/offline schema registries
* how do you enforce data governance
* building consensus among leadership
* articulating _what a data platform is_ to leadership
* _if you have more, please add to this list..._

it's time to band together, and learn from each other. maybe by amplifying our voices, we can start educating and affecting change in tech leadership to understand and think deeply about issues in this space.

there's been a recent string of communities popping up in the data space. lockdown and the pandemic has a way of bringing systemic issues to the forefront. folks had had enough with escalations of broken metrics, ad-hoc business requests, and feeling like code monkeys.

so professionasl did what's natural: band togeth

at my first job, i had no idea what "data engineering" was as a discipline. "data platform" wasn't a term; data science was coined the "sexiest job of the 21st century", and people were figuring out what "analysts" were.
