There's a consistent theme to how I frame thoughts and opportunities post-college: I'd expose myself to something new, dig in, then pull back and reassess. No matter what happens however, I always ask this question: could I be much further along at this moment? What adjustments can I make to learn more and become better?

It's often hard to tell. I think that in life, as in lifting, progress is made by big jumps. Smaller insights build on each other and eventually produce a consistent experience. The enemies are patience and direction, not ability.

How can we create the analogies of lifting programs for our careers? The best way seems to be through mentors; we need to accumulate various ones throughout our careers, and seek out the right ones. A few quality mentors seem to be better than a lot of not well-connected ones.

What do you do when you're stuck? In lifting, you deload by 10-20% and keep going. The only path is forward, and with consistent effort you will almost certainly move forward. Careers aren't as linear as moving forward, but they are similar in terms of progress. Step back a bit, reassess, and keep going.

The question of "could I be doing better" is an unfair question because it assumes ideal settings, which is never the case. If there's low-hanging fruit or massive inefficiencies, eliminate them and move onto the next level. Otherwise, small, less-than-ideal conditions are a part of life.
