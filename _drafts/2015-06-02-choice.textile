Personality is dictated by a choice that one makes early on in life and sticks to. Over time, as it becomes easier and instinctive to make that choice, people start to see it as an identifying charactersitic of themselves.

Have a warm personality? You probably chose to see the good side of people, situations, and the weather.

Cynical / pessimistic? You prpbably saw the ugly side, and chose to be wary.

Philosophical? Someone told you at one point in your life that there was more than just existing, that there was a "why", and that we were here on earth to find out why. And you chose to believe them.

If this choice sounds arbitrary, it's because it is. You didn't have to choose to be influenced by what the other person said, and you certainly didn't have to interpret an experience one way or the other. But later on these choices, and these experiences, start to define who you are. It's almost as if, <i>arbitrarily</i>, we come into being, into self-awareness.
