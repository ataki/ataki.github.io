Some quick notes on searching (jobs & dating):

* The challenge is keeping perspective. Searching requires you to dive in and evaluate each lead. Whether you do it thoroughly or not doesn't matter. It's also human nature to be tempted by bait, and any decent candidate throws bait the instant they come into contact with you.

* The other challenge is patience. Your current situation is not that bad; it just doesn't look that good compared to new offers. It gives you an adrenaline rush. Don't fall for the traps your own mind sets.

* Settling, or rather the feeling of, is the innate force that drives change. Capitalists are by default never instructed to settle.
