This weekend, driven by a mix of nostalgia and boredom, I played 50 straight chess games.

On Friday, I watched the Netflix series Queens Gambit and overwhelming emotion that was slightly foreign. What came over me?

I suspect this is what happens when you see your own life story being told in a major way. You feel
* understood
* motivated

Growing up, I never saw most of my childhood stories being portrayed in media. The airways were focused on making sense of the mid-20's to mid-40's chunk with shows like Friends, The Simpsons, Seinfeld, and later the Office.

Queen's Gambit is special for a few reasons.
* The way I learned chess is the exact same way Beth Harmon learn sit
* Chess players are quirky
* Protagonist is a woman

The main character seems to be a mix of many world champions. Was Beth modeled after Bobby Fischer? Morphy? Judit Polgar or Hou Yifan? It feels like she's a mixture of all of these.
