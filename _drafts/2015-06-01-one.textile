Wonderfully shot piece by Wong Fu called "One". If you haven't watched it, the link is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2G-pK75h7g">here</a>

This is the tenth time in the past 3 years I've watched the video. The first few times, I was enjoying the wonderful closeups, and the sights and sounds of NYC, my hometown.

Later I looked up the lead actor (Wang Lee Hom) in the short, and realized that this is in a very real sense his life story. He was an American-born Asian American who eventually had a choice to remain in America or explore his opportunities in Taiwan. He chose to go overseas, and was rewarded for his efforts. But he could have just as easily stayed, and become the street performer in NYC. Either way he would have enjoyed what was doing but ... it does us to consider the other possibilities. What's stopping you from going to your metaphorical Taiwan?

Thanks Wong Fu for reminding us of the many possibilities, and encouraging us to march forward.
