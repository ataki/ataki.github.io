Flow by Mikhail C. describes the mental state of flow and theorizes on how it impacts society.
though his thoery is high level and backed by indirect empirical evidence,
I find his theory compelling for building a mental model for running a happy team.

# Flow

like a society, a team is maximally happy when each of its members is in "flow",
or the state characterized by:

* being engrossed in complex work
* complex enough to require growth of self
* work that is challenging 
* work that gives immediate feedback

flow is an experience that can be controlled and simulated. it can be different
for each person, but the common denominator is the result: the sensation that
the self has become more "complex".

mikhail extrapolates empirical results of his studies on flow to societal structures.
although i believe this overreaches, i find his observations useful when applied
to a work setting.

# Flow at work

extrapolating from mikhail's work on flow:

the more tasks we can give team members that put them into a state of flow,
the longer we keep team mates content. the longer we keep team mates content,
the more we contribute to a sense of self-growth for each member, and as an
emergent property, a sense of team growth.

so we need to find technical work that:

* is complex (work that differentiates & integrates)
* is not too hard (beyond current skills of team)
* is not disruptable
