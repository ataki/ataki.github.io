This question came up on a ClubHouse panel yesterday

> What is the difference between a data scientist (analyst) and ml engineer?

And possibly, as a follow-up question

> How do I choose which role to start a career in?

10 years ago, I asked the same question to myself. Since then, I've had the chance to see multiple evolutions of definitions of these roles. Here's my note to myself in my 20's.

1. The Difference is in the Problem You Tackle

* there's a "role" that a company defines
* there's a role that you should also define -> your ideal role
* sift thru the BS

2. How do I choose?
* once you have ideal state defined, lay out concrete steps to get there. be deliberate
* say "no" to companies that don't match the role
* go long

3. How do I grow?
* find your idols
* grow your understanding
