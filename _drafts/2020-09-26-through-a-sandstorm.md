title: wading through a sandstorm
---

a friend and mentor once told me that the work environment at my growth startup feels like wading through a sandstorm. this feels like the right analogy, but i wondered why it rang so true.

there are two notable aspects about wading through sandstorms. one, there's a consistent unpleasantness to the experience, no eye of the storm moment. second, you can't really see where you're going. you just keep moving forward, knowing that if you keep walking in a single direction, it's going to eventually lead you out.

working at flexport during its growth phase feels exactly this way. it's a real grind-it-out business like amazon, doordash, and instacart. no surprise, these companies are all in logistics. but these companies also have main business lines that are "grind-it-out" business defined by low margin (compared to traditional software companies) and . doordash takes 30% from the top-line of restaurants, for example.

in these types of companies, the conventional strategy is (roughly) to get to scale quickly and use scale + technology to create a moat against competitors. during the scaling phase, technology decisions are dictated by operational needs. codebases reflect this need like the rings of a tree. you frequently see bizarre, non-standard tech choices that make no sense out of context. survival and speed are king.

the other type of tech company have tech-driven business lines that print money - google, stripe, coinbase. bc these main business lines practically grow themselves, tech decisions tend to be thought out and consensus-driven. working at these tech orgs feels more like a cross-country road trip.

i don't know if this is a dichotomy; there might be more categories than these. but it's helpful to know why - and that you're in good company, even when the going gets tough.
