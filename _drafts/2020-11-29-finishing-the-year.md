Time to reflect on the year. These are questions I ask of our own team.

As a Team
* what actions have we taken to move the company forward?
    - define new strategy
    - influence org thinking
    - cross-team pollination
* what actions have we taken that were very valuable?
    - define direction
    - contribute to core monolith
    - explore aws
    - cross-team collab
* which relationships are most important to our success?
    - our platform customers (ds, insights, eng)
    - external
* did our actions reflect our values?
    - hard to answer, what are our team values?
    - we own our projects
    - we empower our customers
    - we play the long game.
    - did not go deep to understand how our tools connect to other parts of the
      business
    - did not strengthen feedback loops. there were none
    - did not practice OODA. we did not observe well enough
