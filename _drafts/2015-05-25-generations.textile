I just came across an old email inviting a group of friends to see the Harry Potter 7 Part 2 Premier. It feels like it's been so long.

Recently while exploring the city, I've noticed people talking about Mad Max, Avengers, Snapchat, and Vine. I've chosen not to venture
into those territories. I think back to what our generation had - Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Dark Knight, Facebook - the texture
feels so much richer by comparison.

Then I stop myself and realize that that's exactly what the previous half generation thinks about us. Except we have our Macbooks and smartphones
and now drones and 3d printers. It's not everyday yet, but it's getting there. Which begs the question, what'll happen next? I'll keep
my eyes peeled.
