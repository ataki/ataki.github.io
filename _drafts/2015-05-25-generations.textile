I just came across an old email inviting a group of friends to see the Harry Potter 7 Part 2 Premier. It feels like it's been so long.

Recently while exploring the city, I've noticed people talking about Mad Max, Avengers, Snapchat, and Vine. I've chosen not to venture
into those territories. I think back to what the current generation has seen culturally, and it's been overwhelming.

A long time ago I took a class at Stanford in which the professor posted his theory of inheritance: namely, that there are 4 tracks that one 
generation passes off to the other - genetic, cultural, social, and environmental. I wonder whether technology fits neatly into any of these 
categories; it seems to touch every aspect, and I wonder if we need to start talking about the technological landscape we leave the next
generation with.
