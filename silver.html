      TLDR: Check out <a href="http://geoff.greer.fm/ag/">Ag: The Silver Searcher</a>. It will allows you to tear through small-to-medium (5-30k) codebases and grok much faster than ack/grep.

      <br/><br/>

      I didn't realize this until just now, but I pick up new codebases much faster than I used to. I thought this was due in part to switching over to VIM and its plugin ecosystem, but it's got nothing to do with that.

      It has to with the ack/grep replacement I found: Ag (link above).

      Ag display search results in an organized, intuitive way:

      After migrating to it, I've found myself being able to intuitively "see" the relationships among modules in codebases very quickly. Not being accustom to IDE's, I rely on the speed of VIM, grep, and git to emulate the power of Eclipse / Xcode. AG, being just that much faster, keeps up with my thinking rate; I don't have to wait around for searches anymore; I use fewer keystrokes to find what I need.

      When this process became intuition I'm not sure, but I'm happy for it.
